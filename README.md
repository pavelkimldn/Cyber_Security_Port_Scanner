# Cyber_Security_Port_Scanner

The purpose of this project is to develop a sophisticated port scanner using Python to identify open ports on a given IP address range. This tool can be invaluable for network security assessments, allowing users to identify potential vulnerabilities by discovering open ports that could be exploited by attackers. The port scanner simulates scanning multiple IP addresses and visualizes the results using advanced techniques like 3D scatter plots and heatmaps, creating an engaging and impressive representation of network data. The project not only demonstrates practical skills in network programming and cybersecurity but also showcases proficiency in data visualization to highlight patterns and potential security issues. This combination of functionality and visual appeal makes the project a valuable addition to any cybersecurity portfolio.
