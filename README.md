# Cyber_Security_Port_Scanner

The purpose of this project was to develop a simple port scanner using Python to identify open ports on a given IP address range. This tool can be invaluable for network security assessments, allowing users to identify potential vulnerabilities by discovering open ports that could be exploited by attackers. To demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of the port scanner, I created sample data to run tests on the code. The results were then visualized using advanced techniques, including a heatmap of open ports by IP (fig 1), a 3D scatter plot of open ports (fig 2), and a distribution plot of open ports (fig 3).
